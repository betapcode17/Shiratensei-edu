        <p><strong>Hau:</strong> Hey sweetheart, how was your school day?</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phu:</strong> Hi daddy, it’s good! We learned about the days
          of the week and months of the year in class.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hau:</strong> That’s great! So, do you remember the days of
          the week my baby?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phu:</strong> Yeh! There’s Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
          Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hau:</strong> Well, excellent! And how about the months of the
          year?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phu:</strong> Uh - uhm. There’s January, February, March,
          April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and
          December.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hau:</strong> Wow, wonderful! You’ve got them all down. That’s
          my boy. Haha. Well, what’s your birthday, my honey?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phu:</strong> I think it’s July. My auntie’s birthday is also
          in July.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hau:</strong> That’s right! And the date is 18th, July 18th.
          Remember that date so you can ask your mommy for a doll for your
          birthday later in the year.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Phu:</strong> Oke, my daddy.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hau:</strong> What about something else, how about your
          friend? You said you have a crush on a girl in your class, is that
          right? What’s her name?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phu:</strong> She’s Nhi, daddy. Lemme tell you, she’s an
          elegant girl with blonde hair, she’s really good at Literature, and so
          kind, daddy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hau:</strong> Sounds great, Phu! Well, you know, you’re a
          sympathetic, warm-hearted boy. I think she belongs with you, my baby.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Phu:</strong> Really, dad? I want to marry her. She’s the
          reason behind my smiles.
